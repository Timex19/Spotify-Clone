## Description of the Application

This simple Spotify Web Application was made using React & Spotify API. The data on the application is directly linked to a JSON file. Any changes to the application can be made in the src folder. You're allow to customize it the way want, and if there is any way to improve the functionality of this application kindly share it with me.
